# Volume-Controller-using-OpenCV

 This project is simiar to Hand-gesture-recognition but here with the help of python library named 'pyautogui', I used the gestures to control the volume of the system.

 Using this code, you can generate the colored dataset on your own. Gestures that are shown inside the ROI box can be stored by pressing the respective class button(say 0 or 1 or 2) in the keyboard.
